# Course Router

The router created by this express server is for capturing our course data in an api format. POSTman lets you GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE from this rest API using the given course format. Each course has a date, so with a respective react app, we would be able to sort and categorize these based on that. For now, all we need to see is that we can GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE from this rest API properly.
